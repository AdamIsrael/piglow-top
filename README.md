PiGlow Top
==========

PiGlow Top is a real-time CPU utilization monitor for the Raspberry Pi 2 that
displays its output on a PiGlow.


Usage
-----

PiGlow Top accepts two parameters:

- brightness: LED brightness

  This is the percentage of max LED brightness (between 0 and 1.0).

- period: CPU poll period (in milliseconds)

  This is how often CPU utilization info is gathered from the system (i.e. how
  quickly the PiGlow is updated).

```bash
snap install piglow-top
snap connect piglow-top:i2c pi2:i2c-1
snap start piglow-top
```
